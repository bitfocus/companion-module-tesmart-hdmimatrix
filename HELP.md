## TESmart Matrix

Actions 

This module is for the TESmart matrix switch

There are three actions Select Input, Select Output, All outputs to selected channel

The Select Input action is used to set the source input of a matrix switch for the channel configured

The Switch Output action is used to set the configured channel to take input from the selected input

The All outputs action sets every output to take the selected input

The In to Out action allows you so set up any combination of input top output switching

There are buttons to Save/Read device presets, mirror inputs to outputs and to turn the buzzer on and off

Feedbacks

There are feedbacks to set the style of the selected input, the selected output for the configured channel 

Presets

There are preset buttons for many of these actions. The Select Input and Switch Output presets use module variables to show input and ouput routes in the text of the buttons and feedbacks to show the selected input and the output routes associated with an input when selected. This works best if you set up a row of Select Inputs buttons and a row of Switch output buttons. This will give a flexible set of controls to manage routing for the device
